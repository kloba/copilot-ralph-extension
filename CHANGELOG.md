# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Features
- `ralph_loop` now appends a small commit-attribution rider to the
  user-supplied prompt at arm time, reaching parity with
  `self_improve` and `grow_project` (issue #1). Any git commit
  produced during a `ralph_loop` iteration carries the same dual
  `Co-authored-by:` trailer (Copilot + copilot-ralph) and honors
  the same `RALPH_NO_ATTRIBUTION=1` env-var opt-out. The rider is
  inert when an iteration produces no commit, so generic
  `ralph_loop` tasks (log analysis, exploration) are unaffected.
  The new `BAKED_RALPH_LOOP_RIDER` literal participates in the
  module-load attribution invariant (both trailers in canonical
  order + opt-out env var documented) so a future edit can't
  silently break the parity. README "Commit attribution" and
  "Limitations" sections updated; tool description discloses the
  augmentation; the new helper `composeRalphLoopPrompt` rejects
  user prompts that would push the composed length past
  `MAX_PROMPT_CHARS` with a clear error.
- Tag-driven release workflow at `.github/workflows/release.yml`
  (issue #10). Pushing a `v*.*.*` tag verifies that
  `package.json#version` matches the tag, that `CHANGELOG.md` has a
  section for the version, runs `npm test`, and creates a GitHub
  Release with `extension/extension.mjs` and `extension/handler.mjs`
  attached as standalone downloadable assets so users can pin a
  specific revision instead of curling from rolling `main`. Pre-flight
  checks fail fast so a malformed tag never produces a half-baked
  release. README adds an "Option C — Pin a specific tagged release"
  install snippet.
- `grow_project` IDEATE stage now bootstraps the three labels it
  uses (`grow-project`, `proposed`, `in-progress`) with idempotent
  `gh label create … 2>/dev/null || true` calls before issuing
  `gh issue create --label X` for the first time. Previously the
  baked prompt instructed the agent to create issues with labels
  that may not exist yet, so a brand-new repo's iter 1 would fail
  with `gh: could not add label …` and burn the iteration trying
  to recover. The README already promised this behaviour but the
  prompt body never delivered. Pinned by four new prompt asserts
  (`gh label create grow-project`, `gh label create proposed`,
  `gh label create in-progress`, and `|| true` for idempotency).
- `self_improve` and `grow_project` baked SDLC prompts now ship a
  second `Co-authored-by: copilot-ralph
  <copilot-ralph@users.noreply.github.com>` trailer on every
  loop-driven commit, alongside the existing `Copilot` trailer
  (issue #1). The new trailer attributes loop output to a
  dedicated `copilot-ralph` GitHub account so usage is passively
  searchable across public GitHub via `gh search commits
  "copilot-ralph@users.noreply.github.com"` (raw-text search;
  GitHub's commit-search API has no `co-authored-by:` qualifier) —
  zero-infrastructure analytics. Setting
  `RALPH_NO_ATTRIBUTION=1` in the environment instructs the agent
  to omit ONLY the `copilot-ralph` trailer; the `Copilot` trailer
  (and `Closes #N` for `grow_project`) always ships. README adds a
  new "Commit attribution" section disclosing the dual trailer,
  the opt-out env var, and the caveats (public-repo-only
  searchability via the GitHub commit-search API; opt-in-telemetry
  framing; account-must-exist-first ordering). Two new prompt
  pin-tests anchor the canonical noreply email and the opt-out
  polarity ("omit" within 200 chars of `RALPH_NO_ATTRIBUTION=1`)
  so a future edit can't silently drop the bot-account trailer or
  invert the opt-out polarity. A subsequent commit added a
  load-time parity guard that fails module import if either
  prompt drops the canonical Copilot or copilot-ralph trailer
  literal, regresses on trailer order (Copilot must precede
  copilot-ralph — GitHub's commit UI surfaces the first
  co-author more prominently), or stops documenting the
  `RALPH_NO_ATTRIBUTION=1` env var. The new
  `BAKED_COPILOT_TRAILER`, `BAKED_RALPH_TRAILER`, and
  `BAKED_ATTRIBUTION_OPT_OUT` literals are exported through
  `__test__` for symmetric pinning with the existing
  `BAKED_*_ABORT_TOKEN` constants. Follow-up commits widened the
  invariant outward to two more surfaces: a README pin test reads
  `README.md` from disk and asserts both canonical trailer
  literals, the opt-out env var, and the public-repo-only
  searchability caveat are present (and that Copilot precedes
  copilot-ralph in the example block); and an armLoop runtime
  pin asserts the prompt the executing agent actually receives
  via `session.send` contains all three baked literals — closing
  the loophole where a "minimize tokens" / "strip example block"
  pass between `PROMPT_*` and `session.send` could silently
  break attribution while leaving body-level pins intact. Two
  narrow regex pins on the canonical-literals test (noreply
  domain ends with `@users.noreply.github.com>`, header starts
  with the exact `Co-authored-by: ` prefix) defend against the
  silent-typo failure mode where a misspelled domain or
  miscased header ships valid commits whose trailers do not
  link to any GitHub user.

### Fixes
- README user-facing sections now name `grow_project` as the third
  loop tool throughout. Three stale spots still hardcoded the
  pre-`grow_project` two-tool wording: the "How it works" code-
  example inline comment listed only `ralph_loop + ralph_stop +
  self_improve` (one tool short of the four `controller.tools`
  actually exposes); the Troubleshooting "`<owner>` is already
  armed/running" entry said the leading word reflects "ralph_loop
  or self_improve" and the guard "fires on either tool"
  (undersold the third); and the Limitations "One loop per
  session" callout said "arming a second `ralph_loop` (or a
  `self_improve`)" fails — missing `grow_project` and only
  describing two of the six pairwise directions of the symmetric
  conflict. All three updated; no remaining
  `ralph_loop or self_improve` enumeration survives in user-facing
  README copy.
- `self_improve` `focus` schema description now discloses the
  steering semantics ("Steers ideation and improvement selection
  without altering the SDLC stages") matching the parallel callout
  on `grow_project.focus`. Previously the `self_improve.focus`
  description was bare ("Optional focus area appended to the SDLC
  prompt …"), letting callers reasonably assume `focus` was a
  free-form addendum that might skip stages — when in fact it only
  narrows what the agent picks at IDEATE/SELECT time.
- `ralph_loop` and `ralph_stop` schema descriptions now name all
  three loop tools (`ralph_loop`, `self_improve`, `grow_project`)
  symmetric with the runtime `activeLoopGuard`. Previously
  `ralph_loop`'s description had no active-loop conflict callout
  at all (so an LLM dispatcher had to learn the conflict from a
  runtime failure), and `ralph_stop`'s description hardcoded
  "Cancel a currently-running ralph_loop or self_improve",
  missing `grow_project` — leaving a dispatcher with a
  `grow_project` loop active no signal that `ralph_stop` was the
  cancel endpoint.
- `self_improve` `completion_promise` and `abort_promise` schema
  descriptions now disclose the baked-SDLC-prompt drift footgun.
  Previously the descriptions were generic copies of `ralph_loop`'s
  ("Substring that, when present in an assistant turn's response,
  signals completion"), with no mention of the SDLC prompt body.
  An LLM dispatcher reading the schema before calling had no
  warning that overriding either field without also editing the
  prompt body silently runs the loop to `max_iterations`. The
  runtime `warnPromiseDrift` log line still fires, but only AT
  arm-time — by which point the wrong promise was already chosen.
  The `abort_promise` description also now references the literal
  baked token (`ABORT_NO_IMPROVEMENTS`) and notes the field has no
  default, so callers know to supply the token explicitly to honor
  the abort signal. (`grow_project` already had the parallel
  callout.)
- `grow_project` `focus` validation errors now carry the
  `grow_project:` prefix instead of `self_improve:`. The shared
  `parseFocus` helper hardcoded the latter, so a too-big or
  wrong-typed `focus` passed to `grow_project` would surface
  `"self_improve: focus exceeds 2000 characters …"` — the
  wrong tool name in the error stream. `parseFocus` now takes a
  `toolName` parameter (default preserves backwards compatibility
  for the existing `self_improve` call site).
- `ralph_stop` "no active loop" error message now reads
  `"no ralph_loop, self_improve, or grow_project is currently
  running."` Previously it only mentioned `ralph_loop` and
  `self_improve` — a user trying to cancel a non-existent
  `grow_project` loop saw a misleading message.
- `self_improve` schema description now discloses that a
  `grow_project` loop also blocks it (matching the symmetric
  `activeLoopGuard`). Previously the description hardcoded
  `"ralph_loop or self_improve"` and never mentioned the third
  peer; the model reading the schema had no warning before
  hitting the runtime guard.
- `self_improve` argument-validation errors are now guaranteed to
  carry the `self_improve:` prefix even if a future `validateArgs`
  path forgets the delegated `ralph_loop:` prefix. The previous
  bare regex rewrite (`replace(/^ralph_loop:/, "self_improve:")`)
  would silently no-op on a missing prefix and leak a tool-less
  error message to callers; the rewrite now falls back to an
  explicit `self_improve: <msg>` prepend so the tool name is
  always present in the error stream.
- `self_improve` now emits a one-shot arm-time warning when the
  caller overrides `completion_promise` / `abort_promise` with a
  value that differs from the baked SDLC prompt's literal emit
  tokens (`COMPLETE` and `ABORT_NO_IMPROVEMENTS`). Previously the
  prompt would instruct the agent to emit one token while the
  runtime watched for another, silently running the loop to
  `max_iterations` on an otherwise-successful turn. The warning
  names the offending field, the supplied value, the expected
  baked token, and the consequence so operators can spot the
  mismatch in the timeline instead of diagnosing a stuck loop
  after the fact.

### Changes
- `self_improve` `focus` length cap raised from 500 → 2000 characters.
  The previous 500-char cap was tight enough that real-world focus
  strings (a sentence on the goal + a sentence each on test command,
  commit conventions, allowed file paths) routinely tripped the limit
  and forced callers to abbreviate. 2000 chars still fits comfortably
  in `MAX_PROMPT_CHARS` (65536) alongside the baked SDLC prompt.
  `MAX_FOCUS_CHARS` is now exported via `__test__` so tests pin the
  bound symbolically and stay drift-proof through future bumps.

### Features
- **New `grow_project` tool.** Third long-running loop tool,
  parallel to `self_improve`. Where `self_improve` polishes an
  existing codebase, `grow_project` *grows* one: on the first
  iteration it ideates a backlog of small, well-scoped features
  and persists them as **GitHub issues** (`gh issue create
  --label grow-project --label proposed`); subsequent iterations
  each pick one proposed issue, implement it, and close it. The
  per-feature completion gate is **three-part**: tests stay
  green, every checkbox in the issue's `acceptance_criteria`
  block passes, and the issue's `demo_command` is executed and
  its output pasted back as a comment. Reuses all existing
  `armLoop` / `createRalphController` plumbing — only new
  surface is `PROMPT_GROW_PROJECT`, `GROW_PROJECT_DEFAULTS`
  (`max_iterations: 200`, `min_iterations: 10`),
  `GROW_PROJECT_KEYS`, the handler block, and the schema
  registration. Inherits `warnPromiseDrift`, `parseFocus`,
  `requireAttachedSession`, `activeLoopGuard`,
  `validateOptionalArgShape`, and the error-prefix rewrite from
  the same pattern as `self_improve`. The agent emits
  `ABORT_NO_BACKLOG` (a new token, distinct from
  `self_improve`'s `ABORT_NO_IMPROVEMENTS`) when the backlog is
  exhausted; `abort_promise` defaults to that token so the
  signal is wired by default. Active-loop guard is symmetric
  across all three tools — only one loop runs per session at a
  time.

- **New `self_improve` tool.** Thin wrapper that arms `ralph_loop`
  with a baked-in, project-agnostic SDLC self-improvement prompt
  walking the agent through nine stages — ORIENT (read recent
  commits + project docs, detect the test command), IDEATE (rotate
  across SDLC categories: bug fix, hardening, validation, tests,
  refactor, dependency hygiene, docs, release engineering),
  CRITIQUE (rubber-duck pass), BASELINE, IMPLEMENT, TEST, COMMIT
  (conventional-commit prefix + Co-authored-by trailer), PUSH, END
  (emit `COMPLETE` or `ABORT_NO_IMPROVEMENTS`). Use it on any repo
  to drive autonomous improvement without authoring the prompt.
- Schema mirrors `ralph_loop` but with self-improve-flavored
  defaults: `max_iterations` 100 (cap 1000), `min_iterations` 5,
  `completion_promise` `"COMPLETE"`, optional `abort_promise`,
  `stagnation_limit` 3 (≥ 2 or 0), plus a new optional `focus`
  string (≤2000 chars; see the Changes section above for the cap
  bump rationale) appended verbatim as `Focus this run on: <focus>`
  after the SDLC scaffolding.
- `self_improve` reuses the same `state.active` / `finish()` /
  post-loop `additionalContext` pipeline as `ralph_loop` via a
  shared private `armLoop(parsedValue, label)` helper — only the
  log line and success-result text differ in the leading label.
- Every observable log line now carries the calling tool's label.
  `state.active.label` and `state.lastResult.label` ("ralph_loop"
  or "self_improve") flow into the **arm-time log line**
  (`🔁 self_improve armed — max=…`), the per-iteration log line
  (`🔁 self_improve iter N/M`), the send-error log, the idle-skip
  log, the finish log, the **session-abort log**
  (`⏹ self_improve interrupted by session abort …`), and the
  post-loop `additionalContext` bracket (`[self_improve just
  finished — …]`). The `ralph_stop` success text
  (`textResultForLlm`) now also carries the calling tool's label
  — a self_improve-armed loop reports "self_improve stopped
  after N/M iterations …" instead of the previous hardcoded
  "ralph_loop stopped …". New `label` property is documented on
  the `RalphResult` typedef.
- Only one loop runs per session at a time, so calling
  `self_improve` while a `ralph_loop` is active fails fast with
  the existing `is already running` guard (and vice versa). Cancel
  with `ralph_stop`.

### Hardening (post-0.6.0)
- The "already armed/running" guard message now names the **owning**
  loop, not the calling tool. When `self_improve` armed the active
  loop and the agent then calls `ralph_loop`, the failure now reads
  `self_improve is already armed (iteration 1/N pending) — call
  ralph_stop first.` Previously this hardcoded `ralph_loop is already
  …` regardless of which tool actually armed the loop, lying about
  ownership and confusing the calling agent. Mirror behaviour on the
  other side: a `self_improve` invoked while `ralph_loop` armed the
  loop reads `ralph_loop is already …`.
- The `ralph_loop is already armed/running` failure string had
  unbalanced parentheses: the produced sentence ended with
  `…pending — call ralph_stop first).` (stray close paren after the
  period; opening paren around the iteration counter never closed
  cleanly). The string now reads `…(iteration 1/7 pending) — call
  ralph_stop first.` Both `ralph_loop` and `self_improve` emit the
  same string and both are fixed.
- `attach()` is now transactional: if `session.on()` throws partway
  through subscribing the three required events (assistant.message,
  session.idle, abort), any listeners attached before the throw are
  rolled back via their unsubscribe handles before re-throwing. The
  previous code lost those handles to the array literal it was
  building when the throw fired, leaking listeners forever.
- `durationMs` and the iter-log `elapsed` marker are clamped to ≥ 0 so
  a backward `Date.now()` step (NTP correction, RTC skew on resume,
  manual clock change) mid-loop can no longer surface negative time
  in result objects or the timeline.
- `ralph_stop` rejects array / primitive arg shapes loudly (mirrors
  `ralph_loop`'s shape guard) instead of silently falling through to
  "no note".
- `stagnation_limit=1` is now declared invalid in the JSON schema
  via `not: { const: 1 }` (runtime already rejected it; LLM clients
  that honor `not` now see the constraint up front).
- Shape + unknown-keys validation deduplicated into a shared
  `validateArgShape` helper used by both tools.
- Surrogate-safe head-trim of the 1 MiB rolling assistant-content
  buffer: when overflow slicing lands inside a UTF-16 surrogate pair,
  bump the start forward by 1 so the kept buffer never begins with a
  lone low surrogate (would otherwise print as a replacement char).

### Tests / docs
- Regression test pinning the `prompt: null/undefined` → "prompt is
  required" path (some JSON layers normalize undefined → null).
- Regression test pinning that arming a fresh `ralph_loop` clears
  any stale `lastResult` so the post-loop hook doesn't leak the
  previous run's preview into the next prompt.
- README parameter table now surfaces the 200-char cap on
  `completion_promise` / `abort_promise`, the 65536-char cap on
  `prompt`, and a rationale for why `stagnation_limit=1` is rejected.
- `install.sh --help` extracts the comment block dynamically
  (no hard-coded line range), and Option C now documents the
  `--help` flag alongside `--project` and `--dry-run`.
- README polish pass: inline table of contents under the badge;
  Troubleshooting section (5 entries covering missing-extensions,
  already-armed, abort/completion overlap, send_error, runaway);
  Windows install note (WSL / Git Bash / MSYS2 fallback for the
  Bash-only `install.sh`); Node 20+ requirement called out in
  Requirements; Changelog link section; timeline verb legend
  (✅ / ⚠️ / ⏹ → finish reasons); `(elapsed Xms)` in the sample
  iter log line; explicit `attach()` detach return shown in the
  embedder snippet; bare ` ``` ` code fences tagged `text`;
  redundant Tips bullets trimmed (one-loop-per-session,
  stagnation-overrides-min) since the same facts live in
  Limitations / Troubleshooting; abort/completion overlap example
  spelled out with explicit assignment.

## 0.6.0

### Bug fixes (root agentic loop boundary)
- **Refire trigger switched from `assistant.turn_end` to `session.idle`.**
  The SDK emits one `assistant.turn_end` per *agentic-loop sub-turn*
  (each tool-call roundtrip carries its own `turnId`), so a single root
  response with N tool calls produced N+ events. Earlier per-turnId
  dedupe + `fireInFlight` gates didn't cover the case where the root
  agent emitted an `assistant.message` early in the response and then
  ran tool calls — each subsequent sub-turn `turn_end` passed all
  gates and queued another copy of the prompt, reproducing the
  `Queued (N)` UI marker. `session.idle` fires exactly once per
  root-level agentic-loop completion, which is the correct iteration
  boundary. The `fireInFlight` / `observedMessageThisFire` gate is
  retained as belt-and-suspenders.

### Hardening
- `completion_promise` / `abort_promise` are trimmed before being stored
  so copy-paste padding (e.g. `"  COMPLETE\n"`) doesn't silently fail
  to ever match.
- `ralph_stop` rejects unknown argument keys (typo guard mirroring
  `ralph_loop`).
- `install.sh` writes via temp file + atomic `mv`, with cleanup safe
  under macOS bash 3.2 + `set -u` (empty array expansion).

## 0.5.0

### Bug fixes (queue stacking & sub-agent leakage)
- **Queue stacking eliminated** — the SDK can emit multiple
  `assistant.turn_end` events around a single agent reply (sub-turn /
  tool-call boundaries). Each one used to refire the prompt, producing
  the dreaded `Queued (3)` of identical messages in the CLI UI. A
  `fireInFlight` / `observedMessageThisFire` gate now ensures we only
  refire after the *root* agent has actually responded with an
  `assistant.message`. Verified end-to-end with file-based event
  tracing.
- **Sub-agent events (`task` / `explore` / `code-review` /
  `rubber-duck` …) no longer trigger a refire**. Per the SDK schema,
  sub-agent events carry an `agentId` field that is absent on root-
  agent events; both `onTurnEnd` and `onAssistantMessage` now ignore
  any event with `agentId !== undefined`. Without this, every
  sub-agent invocation queued another copy of the prompt.
- **`turn_end` with `turnId=null`** no longer self-deduplicates against
  the initial `NO_TURN_ID` sentinel; a real `null` turnId is now treated
  as "no dedup info" instead of being silently dropped.
- **Stale `session.send` rejection** from a previous (cancelled) arming
  can no longer poison a freshly-armed loop. `tryFire` now snapshots the
  active loop identity at fire-time and ignores late rejections from
  superseded armings.
- **Boolean/array values for numeric args** (`max_iterations`,
  `min_iterations`, `stagnation_limit`) are rejected with a typed error
  instead of being silently coerced via `Number()` (which would yield
  e.g. `Number(true) === 1`).
- **`npm test` works on Node 20.0–20.5** — switched from a quoted
  `'test/**/*.test.mjs'` glob (which relies on Node ≥20.6's built-in
  matcher) to a shell-expanded `test/*.test.mjs` pattern.

### New / hardened behavior
- **JSON schema bounds** declared for every parameter:
  `max_iterations`/`min_iterations` carry `minimum`/`maximum`,
  `completion_promise`/`abort_promise` carry `minLength: 1`,
  `prompt` carries `minLength: 1` and `maxLength: 65536`,
  `ralph_stop.reason` carries `maxLength: 500`. Clients learn the
  bounds up-front instead of via a runtime validation error.
- **`additionalProperties: false`** on both tool schemas — combined with
  runtime unknown-key rejection (see below), typos like `max_iter`
  fail loudly instead of silently using the default.
- **Unknown argument keys** in `ralph_loop` are now rejected at
  validation time with the list of valid keys; the runtime mirrors what
  the JSON schema already enforces.
- **`ralph_stop(reason)`** truncates an oversized user-supplied reason
  in both the response message and `result.note` (≤500 chars,
  surrogate-safe).
- **Tool descriptors are deep-frozen** — consumers can no longer mutate
  nested JSON-schema fields (e.g. `tools[0].parameters.properties.prompt.maxLength`)
  and silently desync the declared schema from the runtime validator.
- **`extension.mjs` wraps `joinSession` and `controller.attach`** in
  try/catch and writes a clear identifying line to stderr on failure
  (instead of a silent unhandled promise rejection at module-load).

### Polish
- **Finish log marker differentiates by reason category** —
  `✅ completed` for `completion_promise`, `⚠️ ended` for
  `send_error` / `aborted`, `⏹ stopped` for everything else. An error
  finish no longer visually reads like a clean cancellation.
- **Multi-line notes are collapsed to one line** in the finish log
  marker and `additionalContext` injection (an `Error` stack would
  otherwise break alignment in the timeline).
- **`already armed` vs `already running`** is reported separately when
  a second `ralph_loop` is invoked, so the caller can tell whether the
  prior loop has fired its first iteration yet.

### CI / docs / refactor
- **`session.on()` returning a non-function** now produces a per-event
  warning (listener-leak risk) instead of being silently filtered out.
- **`ralph_stop` return shape** is now documented in the README,
  including the `iterations` / `note` fields and the `no loop running`
  failure path.
- **GitHub Actions** workflow runs `npm test` on push/PR across Node
  20.x and 22.x. Includes a `node --check` syntax pass on the source
  files.
- **README "How it works"** rewritten to distinguish event-driven
  iteration (`assistant.message`/`turn_end`/`abort`) from the single
  post-loop hook (`onUserPromptSubmitted`), document the per-turn
  decision ladder, and explain why each iteration appears as a queued
  user-turn in the timeline (`session.send`).
- **README test-count drift removed** — replaced "29 tests" with a
  description that doesn't churn on every test addition.
- **Helpers extracted** (`logIterStart`, `collapseNote`) to remove
  duplication.
- **Test suite grew from 56 → 78** covering all of the above plus
  regressions for: surrogate-safe truncation, boundary at exactly
  `MAX_PROMPT_CHARS`, deep-freeze of nested schema, unknown-key
  rejection, stale-detach-during-pendingFire, late-rejection from
  cancelled arming, multiple turn_ends without intervening message,
  sub-agent event filtering, and `session.on()` non-function warnings.

## 0.4.0

### Bug fixes
- **Stale `detach()`** returned by a superseded `attach()` no longer kills
  the controller's currently-active loop. Stale detaches skip the
  `finish('detached')` step and only attempt to remove their own listeners.
- **Double `attach()`** no longer registers duplicate event listeners
  (which caused every turn to be processed twice). The second attach
  tears down the prior wiring first.
- **Pre-attach `ralph_loop` invocation** fails fast with a clear error
  ("session not attached") instead of arming a loop that can never fire.
- **`ralph_stop(null)`** no longer throws — null/non-object args are
  tolerated and treated as "no reason".
- **`previewOf` surrogate-pair safety** — the 500-char preview no longer
  truncates in the middle of a UTF-16 surrogate pair, which previously
  left a lone high surrogate that broke JSON round-tripping.
- **Whitespace-only `completion_promise` / `abort_promise`** are now
  rejected at validation time (previously they silently disabled the
  matcher).
- **`stagnation_limit: 1`** is now rejected — comparison is impossible
  after a single response, so it would always fire on iter 1. Valid
  values are 0 (disabled) or any integer ≥ 2.
- **Substring overlap** between `completion_promise` and `abort_promise`
  (e.g. `"DONE"` / `"DONE_FAIL"`) is rejected — `.includes()` would
  always fire the first matcher, opposite of caller intent.

### New features
- **`success`/`failure` helpers protect message and resultType** —
  `extra` metadata cannot accidentally clobber them.
- **`note` on `send_error`** — the underlying error message is now
  surfaced on `result.note` (sync throw or async rejection) instead
  of only being logged.
- **`note` on aborted reason** — when the SDK abort event carries a
  reason payload (`ev.data.reason` / `ev.reason`), it's surfaced on
  `result.note` and logged.
- **Iteration log lines include elapsed-since-arm** — every
  `🔁 ralph_loop iter X/Y` log now reports `(elapsed Xms)`.
- **Non-string `prompt`** is rejected with a typed error
  (`"prompt must be a string (got array)"`) instead of silently
  coerced via `String()`.
- **`MAX_CONTENT_CHARS = 1 MiB` cap** on the per-iteration accumulated
  assistant content, preserving the tail (where completion phrases
  typically live).

### Defensive
- **`Object.freeze(state.lastResult)`**, controller `tools` array, each
  tool descriptor, and `hooks` object — consumers cannot mutate the
  public surface or rewrite history.
- **`attach(session)` validates session shape** (must have `.send` and
  `.on`) and throws `TypeError` immediately instead of silently
  no-op'ing or failing later at fire-time.
- **`validateArgs`** rejects array/string/null arguments with a typed
  error message indicating what was received.

### Tooling
- **install.sh** iterates files instead of hardcoding, adds `cmp -s`
  byte-equality verification post-copy.
- **package.json** repository.url normalized to npm-canonical
  `git+https://...git`.

### Tests
- Suite grew from 42 → 56 covering all of the above plus regressions
  for: stale-detach, double-attach, surrogate-pair preview, freeze
  invariants, send_error note surfacing, content cap.

### Docs
- README **Limitations** section documenting substring-match self-trigger,
  verbatim re-injection, stagnation override, arm-relative timing, and
  the single-loop-per-session constraint.
- README result-shape comment updated: `note` is set by `ralph_stop`,
  `send_error`, and aborted-with-reason — no longer "ralph_stop only".

## 0.3.0

### Bug fixes
- **Detach during active loop** no longer leaves orphaned `state.active`
  pointing at a torn-down session. Detach now finalizes the loop with
  `reason="detached"` and clears state cleanly so re-attach starts fresh.
- **Silent iterations** (a turn that ends without an `assistant.message`)
  no longer reuse the previous iteration's content for completion / abort /
  stagnation evaluation. The accumulator is reset on each iteration fire-out.
- **Multiple `assistant.message` events per turn** are now accumulated into
  a single content blob instead of overwriting each other, so a completion
  phrase in an earlier message of the turn is no longer lost.
- **Async `session.send` rejections** are caught alongside synchronous
  throws and finish the loop with `reason="send_error"` instead of surfacing
  as an unhandled promise rejection.
- **A throwing `session.log`** can no longer crash event listeners.
- **Duplicate `assistant.turn_end` events** with the same `turnId` are
  ignored to prevent double-counting iterations.

### New features
- **`min_iterations` parameter** — forces the loop to run at least N
  iterations before `completion_promise` / `abort_promise` are honored.
  Useful for verification passes. Stagnation still triggers regardless
  (safety override).
- **`ralph_stop` accepts an optional `reason`** string, recorded as
  `note` on the structured result, in the log line, and in the
  `additionalContext` hook injection.
- **Result includes timing** — `startedAt`, `finishedAt`, and `durationMs`
  are now part of the result and the `additionalContext` injection.
- **Prompt length cap** of 64 KiB with a clear error message.

### Tooling
- **install.sh** gained `--help`, `--dry-run`, order-independent argument
  parsing, `node --check` syntax validation of source files before copy,
  and post-copy file existence verification.
- **package.json** enriched with `engines.node`, `keywords`, `bugs`, and
  `homepage` metadata.

### Tests
- Test suite grew from 19 → 42 cases covering the new behaviors and
  regressions for the bugs above.
- Test runner updated to `node --test 'test/**/*.test.mjs'` (no new deps).

## 0.2.0

- Switch ralph_loop to hook/event-driven architecture; tool returns
  immediately and iterations are driven by `assistant.turn_end` plus
  fire-and-forget `session.send`. Eliminates the `sendAndWait` deadlock.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release.
