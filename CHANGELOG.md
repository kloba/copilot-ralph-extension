# Changelog

## 0.4.0

### Bug fixes
- **Stale `detach()`** returned by a superseded `attach()` no longer kills
  the controller's currently-active loop. Stale detaches skip the
  `finish('detached')` step and only attempt to remove their own listeners.
- **Double `attach()`** no longer registers duplicate event listeners
  (which caused every turn to be processed twice). The second attach
  tears down the prior wiring first.
- **Pre-attach `ralph_loop` invocation** fails fast with a clear error
  ("session not attached") instead of arming a loop that can never fire.
- **`ralph_stop(null)`** no longer throws — null/non-object args are
  tolerated and treated as "no reason".
- **`previewOf` surrogate-pair safety** — the 500-char preview no longer
  truncates in the middle of a UTF-16 surrogate pair, which previously
  left a lone high surrogate that broke JSON round-tripping.
- **Whitespace-only `completion_promise` / `abort_promise`** are now
  rejected at validation time (previously they silently disabled the
  matcher).
- **`stagnation_limit: 1`** is now rejected — comparison is impossible
  after a single response, so it would always fire on iter 1. Valid
  values are 0 (disabled) or any integer ≥ 2.
- **Substring overlap** between `completion_promise` and `abort_promise`
  (e.g. `"DONE"` / `"DONE_FAIL"`) is rejected — `.includes()` would
  always fire the first matcher, opposite of caller intent.

### New features
- **`success`/`failure` helpers protect message and resultType** —
  `extra` metadata cannot accidentally clobber them.
- **`note` on `send_error`** — the underlying error message is now
  surfaced on `result.note` (sync throw or async rejection) instead
  of only being logged.
- **`note` on aborted reason** — when the SDK abort event carries a
  reason payload (`ev.data.reason` / `ev.reason`), it's surfaced on
  `result.note` and logged.
- **Iteration log lines include elapsed-since-arm** — every
  `🔁 ralph_loop iter X/Y` log now reports `(elapsed Xms)`.
- **Non-string `prompt`** is rejected with a typed error
  (`"prompt must be a string (got array)"`) instead of silently
  coerced via `String()`.
- **`MAX_CONTENT_CHARS = 1 MiB` cap** on the per-iteration accumulated
  assistant content, preserving the tail (where completion phrases
  typically live).

### Defensive
- **`Object.freeze(state.lastResult)`**, controller `tools` array, each
  tool descriptor, and `hooks` object — consumers cannot mutate the
  public surface or rewrite history.
- **`attach(session)` validates session shape** (must have `.send` and
  `.on`) and throws `TypeError` immediately instead of silently
  no-op'ing or failing later at fire-time.
- **`validateArgs`** rejects array/string/null arguments with a typed
  error message indicating what was received.

### Tooling
- **install.sh** iterates files instead of hardcoding, adds `cmp -s`
  byte-equality verification post-copy.
- **package.json** repository.url normalized to npm-canonical
  `git+https://...git`.

### Tests
- Suite grew from 42 → 56 covering all of the above plus regressions
  for: stale-detach, double-attach, surrogate-pair preview, freeze
  invariants, send_error note surfacing, content cap.

### Docs
- README **Limitations** section documenting substring-match self-trigger,
  verbatim re-injection, stagnation override, arm-relative timing, and
  the single-loop-per-session constraint.
- README result-shape comment updated: `note` is set by `ralph_stop`,
  `send_error`, and aborted-with-reason — no longer "ralph_stop only".

## 0.3.0

### Bug fixes
- **Detach during active loop** no longer leaves orphaned `state.active`
  pointing at a torn-down session. Detach now finalizes the loop with
  `reason="detached"` and clears state cleanly so re-attach starts fresh.
- **Silent iterations** (a turn that ends without an `assistant.message`)
  no longer reuse the previous iteration's content for completion / abort /
  stagnation evaluation. The accumulator is reset on each iteration fire-out.
- **Multiple `assistant.message` events per turn** are now accumulated into
  a single content blob instead of overwriting each other, so a completion
  phrase in an earlier message of the turn is no longer lost.
- **Async `session.send` rejections** are caught alongside synchronous
  throws and finish the loop with `reason="send_error"` instead of surfacing
  as an unhandled promise rejection.
- **A throwing `session.log`** can no longer crash event listeners.
- **Duplicate `assistant.turn_end` events** with the same `turnId` are
  ignored to prevent double-counting iterations.

### New features
- **`min_iterations` parameter** — forces the loop to run at least N
  iterations before `completion_promise` / `abort_promise` are honored.
  Useful for verification passes. Stagnation still triggers regardless
  (safety override).
- **`ralph_stop` accepts an optional `reason`** string, recorded as
  `note` on the structured result, in the log line, and in the
  `additionalContext` hook injection.
- **Result includes timing** — `startedAt`, `finishedAt`, and `durationMs`
  are now part of the result and the `additionalContext` injection.
- **Prompt length cap** of 64 KiB with a clear error message.

### Tooling
- **install.sh** gained `--help`, `--dry-run`, order-independent argument
  parsing, `node --check` syntax validation of source files before copy,
  and post-copy file existence verification.
- **package.json** enriched with `engines.node`, `keywords`, `bugs`, and
  `homepage` metadata.

### Tests
- Test suite grew from 19 → 42 cases covering the new behaviors and
  regressions for the bugs above.
- Test runner updated to `node --test 'test/**/*.test.mjs'` (no new deps).

## 0.2.0

- Switch ralph_loop to hook/event-driven architecture; tool returns
  immediately and iterations are driven by `assistant.turn_end` plus
  fire-and-forget `session.send`. Eliminates the `sendAndWait` deadlock.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release.
